# Intro to Flask app

I created this project to better understand Flask, the python web framework, and how it works. 

## Description

This project uses flask with sqlite3 to get, create, and update posts. Posts can have a title and content that supports simple text. It has multiple routes and navigation in the app.

## Getting Started

There are very few dependencies with this simple app.

### Dependencies

* python venv
* flask
* sqlite3

### Executing program

* To run the app, run
    `flask run`
